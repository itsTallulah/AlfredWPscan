[WPscan](https://wpscan.org/). This flow can install it via `wpscan update` if you don't have it.

# How to use?
Do your usual Alfred invokation thing ðŸŽ© then type wpscan. The 5 keywords will pop up to tell you the rest. Select one, hit return.

# What are the keywords?
`wpscan url example.com` 
`wpscan loadout example.com` 
`wpscan everything example.com`  
`wpscan vuln example.com` 
`wpscan update` 

# Vulnerability Scanning?
If so, you'll need to add an api key from vulndb as an environment variable. Click the `[x]` in the top right of the workflow for details.
