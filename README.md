# AlfredWPscan
It's [WPscan](https://wpscan.org/), wrapped in an Alfred workflow. *With icons.*

# How To Install
Download [WPscanFlow.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/itsTallulah/AlfredWPscan/raw/master/WPscanFlow.alfredworkflow) and double click on it.

Also, of course: install `wpscan` if you haven't already in a terminal with `brew install wpscan`.

# What Then?
Do your Alfred thing ðŸŽ© then type wpscan. The 5 keywords will pop up to tell you the rest.

# What are the keywords?
`wpscan url example.com` 
`wpscan loadout example.com` 
`wpscan everything example.com`  
`wpscan vuln example.com` 
`wpscan update example.com` 

# Vulnerability Scanning?
If so, you'll need to add an api key from vulndb. Click the `[x]` in the top right of the workflow for details.

# Improvements?
It's hard to git Alfred flows, so if you have ideas, ping me~
